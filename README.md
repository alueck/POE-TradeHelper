# POE Trade Helper

Path of Exile trade helper like [POE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro) but written in C# using [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) and querying the official Path of Exile trade API (https://www.pathofexile.com/trade).

This program has been developed with cross-platform compatiblity in mind, but currently only supports Windows, because native implementations for Linux and MacOS for parts of the software are missing. Contributions are welcome.
